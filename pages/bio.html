        <h3>Biography:</h3>
        <img class="unl" src="../images/unl.png" alt="Me in front of the UNL statue" />
            <p> 
                I am originally from Las Vegas, Nevada born and raised. I currently attend the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) as a computer science major with double
                minors in mathematics and psychology. I’ve always had an adept ability in computer programming, and I desire the
                knowledge to apply my skills somewhere or somehow within the medical industry. My ultimate goal is to design new
                technology and/or software which could be used to aid medical staff to efficiently improve patient care and prognosis.

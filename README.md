# CSCE464 Portfolio Website Project

This repository contains the html, css, javascript, and php for a sample website portfolio I created for my CSCE 464 class project.
This project utilizes both html components and bootstrap components as well as css for styling for the frontend. For the backend, various JS libraries such as PDF.js and Chart.js are used to create features within the Resume and Contact pages. Also, MySQL databases are used to store different types of data. Mailhog is used to create a fake SMTP simulation for the email portion of the contact page.
